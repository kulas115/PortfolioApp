<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a junior rails developer with a lot of mettle to become master rather sooner than later. I have started my codding jurney with creating Wordpress sites. They were quite easy to set up but every modyfication of existing template was a challange. I've leared how painful CSS can be but also how helpful bit of Javascript could be. I am trying to "soak" into coding by surrounding myself with quality coding content all day long. </p>
